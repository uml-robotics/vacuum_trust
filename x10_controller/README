You must install heyu https://github.com/HeyuX10Automation/heyu/releases
Then you must setup your configure file in /etc/heyu/x10.conf
Inside x10.conf added all devices that you will be using as:
   ex. ALIAS docks M3
       // docks could be replaced with the desired module name
       // M would be the "housecode" on the X10 module, in this case M
       // check the lettered dial on your module to see what it's set too.
       // 3 is the unit code, check the numbered dial on your module to see
       // what it's set too
Make sure device path is properly set
Make sure binary path is properly set, it should be /local/usr/bin/heyu

roslaunch heyu_X10 heyu.launch, interface with the modules as services. 
Use /heyu/MODULENAME/command to change their state, use /heyu/MODULENAME/state 
to query the modules current state.
